Dear USCIS Officer,

I am writing this letter of support for SM Amin Gilani with respect to his Permanent Residency application in the category EB-2 National Interest Waiver.

While I do not know Amin very well personally, I am very familiar with his knowledge of software engineering, his entrepreneurial spirit and his various contributions to open source projects in the form of reports and code. Amin has proven himself to be an expert engineer having won multiple international and hackathons, and by passing screening for Toptal, a US engineering firm that approves less than 3% of applicants; making it more selective about its partners than the Navy SEALs. Amin has also proven his recognition in the entrepreneurial ecosystem by having his startup picked out of over 2,000 in 2015 by Plan9, Pakistan and over 500 applicants to Boost VC, California.

The US has one of the greatest entrepreneurial environments in the world, and according to a nonpartisan study, 51% of billion-dollar companies were founded by immigrant founders[^1] and a report by the Office of Legislative Research, CT summarizes “Startups are the primary driver of job growth in the U.S. economy, accounting for nearly all net job growth.”[^2] Venture Capitalists have known this for a long time and Sam Altman, president Y Combinator has been advocating for a new class of entrepreneurial visas for years[^3]. It is in the national interest of the United States to remain a leader in the global business sector, and to support new businesses and immigrant founders as the driver of job growth in our economy.

To ensure the success of the development of technology related startup businesses, the availability of experts such as Amin is critical. In fact, Amin’s continued availability for consultation, and leadership in many startup businesses and engineering projects has been vital for their success.

In short, I strongly recommend, in the national interest of the United States, that SM Amin Gilani’s application for Permanent Residency in category EB-2 National Interest Waiver be approved. I have no doubt he would be an asset to the United States and to the industry he works in. I can be reached by phone or email if any further information is necessary.
