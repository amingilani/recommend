Dear USCIS Officer,

I am writing this letter of support for SM Amin Gilani with respect to his Permanent Residency application in the category EB-2 National Interest Waiver.

<!-- REPLACE THIS ENTIRE PARAGRAPH

Talk a bit about yourself, your accomplishments, and the USCIS should listen to you. Don't be humble. Talk about everything awesome you've ever done.

Talk about the responsibilities you've taken in your life, the kind of projects you've contributed to, and the kind of work you've done.

Sample:

My name is Steve Jobs. In 1976 I co-founded Apple, a company that went on to dominate the global technology industry and in 2017 became the most valuable company of all time. After founding Apple I also contributed to several other major companies such as NeXT, a company that was bought by Apple in 1997, and funded what is now known as Pixar, a computer animation company.

Talk a bit about yourself, your accomplishments, and why the USCIS should listen to you. Don't be humble. Talk about everything awesome you've ever done. (COMMENT: You mean to say talk a bit about you, Amin, and how we know you, no?)

Talk about the responsibilities you've taken in your life, the kind of projects you've contributed to, and the kind of work you've done.

Sample:

I first met Amin in the fall of 2015 in San Mateo, as a startup founder for a Silicon Valley VC funded company. Amin spent most of his nights working on his company software, and would sometimes work out of the office for days, straight, without regard to his personal health. I believe Amin is one of the most passionate founders I have met and when driven, does not rest until he has achieved his tasks.

While I do not know Amin very well personally, I am very familiar with his knowledge of software engineering, his entrepreneurial spirit and his various contributions to open source projects in the form of reports and code. Amin has proven himself to be an expert engineer having won multiple international and hackathons, and by passing screening for Toptal, a US engineering firm that approves less than 3% of applicants; making it more selective about its partners than the Navy SEALs. Amin has also proven his recognition in the entrepreneurial ecosystem by having his startup picked out of over 2,000 in 2015 by Plan9, Pakistan and over 300 possible software solutions by Boost VC.

The US has one of the greatest entrepreneurial environments in the world, and according to a non-partisan study, 51% of billion-dollar companies were founded by immigrant founders[^1] and a report by the Office of Legislative Research, CT summarizes “Startups are the primary driver of job growth in the U.S. economy, accounting for nearly all net job growth.”[^2] Venture Capitalists have known this for a long time and Sam Altman, president Y Combinator has been advocating for new class of entrepreneurial visas for years[^3]. It is in the national interest of the United States to remain a leader in the global business sector, and to support new businesses and immigrant founders as the driver of job growth in our economy.

To ensure the success of the development of technology related startup businesses, the availability of experts such as Amin is critical. In fact, Amin’s continued availability for consultation, and leadership in many startup businesses and engineering projects has been vital for their success.

In short, I strongly recommend, in the national interest of the United States, that SM Amin Gilani’s application for Permanent Residency in category EB-2 National Interest Waiver be approved. I have no doubt he would be an asset to the United States and to the industry he works in. I can be reached by phone or email if any further information is necessary.
