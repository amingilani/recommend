Dear <%= @r.first_name %>

Thank you for recommending me. No, really, thank you. This may not have
seemed like much, but this was huge for me. If there's ever any
way I could make it up to you, please don't hesitate to reach out.

At the very least, I owe you a coffee.

I've asked too much of you already, but I must impose one last time. Please
share this email with 2-3 other influential people whose recommendations you
believe will have an impact on my application.

Let them know that they can help a young entrepreneur move from Pakistan
