      <p>
        The visa category I'm applying for is the EB2-NIW, and your recommendation will help certify that:
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>I have exceptional abilities</li>
          <li>It is in the national interest of the United States to waive requirements, like an employement offer, required for a regular EB-2 visa</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
        I've provided a template letter to help get you started. Please:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Replace the <code>AboutMe</code> line with a bit about yourself, your accomplishments, and why the USCIS should give weight to your recommendation. Don't be humble. e.g.
          <blockquote>
            My name is Steve Jobs. In 1976 I co-founded Apple, a company that went on to dominate the global technology industry and in 2017 became the most valuable company of all time. After founding Apple I also contributed to several other major companies such as NeXT, a company that was bought by Apple in 1997, and funded what is now known as Pixar, a computer animation company.
          </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
          Replace the <code>AboutAmin</code> line with your personal opinions about Amin, how you find him. e.g.
          <blockquote>
            I first met Amin in the fall of 2015 in San Mateo, as a startup founder for a Silicon Valley VC funded company. Amin spent most of his nights working on his company software, and would sometimes work out of the office for days, straight, without regard to his personal health. I believe Amin is one of the most passionate founders I have met and when driven, does not rest until he has achieved his tasks.
          </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
          Change the letter however you like. Make it your own. The template is meant to help you get started, but you're welcome to change it entirely if you feel.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><em>You don't have to be a US citizen to recommend me!</em> <strong>Thank you</strong> for taking the time to recommend me. Your 5 minutes will help change my life.</p>
